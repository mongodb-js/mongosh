# This bash script expects FLE_NODE_SOURCE_PATH to be the path to a Node.js
# checkout which contains OpenSSL, and where the relevant headers and library
# files for the mongodb-client-encryption addon will be stored after
# compiling them.

# One thing that is not obvious from the build instructions for libmongocrypt
# and the Node.js bindings is that the Node.js driver uses libmongocrypt in
# DISABLE_NATIVE_CRYPTO aka nocrypto mode, that is, instead of using native
# system libraries for crypto operations, it provides callbacks to libmongocrypt
# which, in the Node.js addon case, call JS functions that in turn call built-in
# Node.js crypto methods.
# Thatâ€™s way more convoluted than it needs to be, considering that we always
# have a copy of OpenSSL available directly, but for now it seems to make sense
# to stick with what the Node.js addon does here.

# This isn't a lot, but hopefully after https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WRITING-7164
# we'll be able to simplify this further.
