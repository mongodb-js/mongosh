         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
      ==========================
      
      Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
      Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
      as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
      principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
      
      In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
      National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
      in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
      software.
      
      In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
      BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
      year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
      Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
      https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
      created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
      Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
      
      All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
      the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
      releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
      the various releases.
      
          Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                          from                                compatible? (1)
      
          0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
          1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
          1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
          2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
          1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
          2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
          2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
          2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
          2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
          2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
          2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
      
      Footnotes:
      
      (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
          the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
          a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
          GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
          other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
      
      (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
          because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
          CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
          is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
      
      Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
      direction to make these releases possible.

            source, and configuration files.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier

      Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
      does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
      Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
      other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
      information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
      warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
      terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
      disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
      fullest extent possible.
      
      Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
      
      Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
      conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
      original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
      and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
      following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
      exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
      
           Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
           intended for use by those authorized to give the public
           permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
           copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
           irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
           and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
           Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
           applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
           material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
           material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
           licensed material, or material used under an exception or
           limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
      	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
      
           Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
           licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
           licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
           the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
           example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
           copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
           licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
           other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
           the licensed material may still be restricted for other
           reasons, including because others have copyright or other
           rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
           such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
           Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
           respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

      Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
      
      By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
      to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
      Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
      extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
      granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
      these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
      consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
      Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
      
      
      Section 1 -- Definitions.
      
        a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
           Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
           and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
           arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
           permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
           Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
           Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
           Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
           synched in timed relation with a moving image.
      
        b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
           and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
           accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
      
        c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
           closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
           performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
           Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
           categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
           specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
           Rights.
      
        d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
           absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
           fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
           Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
           agreements.
      
        e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
           any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
           that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
      
        f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
           or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
           License.
      
        g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
           terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
           all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
           Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
      
        h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
           under this Public License.
      
        i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
           process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
           as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
           dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
           available to the public including in ways that members of the
           public may access the material from a place and at a time
           individually chosen by them.
      
        j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
           resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
           the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
           as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
           equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
      
        k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
           under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
      
      
      Section 2 -- Scope.
      
        a. License grant.
      
             1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
      
                  a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                     in part; and
      
                  b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
      
             2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                its terms and conditions.
      
             3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                6(a).
      
             4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                (4) never produces Adapted Material.
      
             5. Downstream recipients.
      
                  a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                     recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                     receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                     Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                     Public License.
      
                  b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                     any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                     apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                     Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                     Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                     Material.
      
             6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
      
        b. Other rights.
      
             1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                Rights, but not otherwise.
      
             2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                Public License.
      
             3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                reserves any right to collect such royalties.
      
      
      Section 3 -- License Conditions.
      
      Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
      following conditions.
      
        a. Attribution.
      
             1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                form), You must:
      
                  a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                     with the Licensed Material:
      
                       i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                          Material and any others designated to receive
                          attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                          the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                          designated);
      
                      ii. a copyright notice;
      
                     iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
      
                      iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                          warranties;
      
                       v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                          extent reasonably practicable;
      
                  b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                     retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
      
                  c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                     Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                     hyperlink to, this Public License.
      
             2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                information.
      
             3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                reasonably practicable.
      
             4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
                License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
                Material from complying with this Public License.
      
      
      Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
      
      Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
      apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
      
        a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
           to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
           portion of the contents of the database;
      
        b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
           contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
           Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
           Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
      
        c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
           all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
      
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
      replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
      Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
      
      
      Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
      
        a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
           EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
           AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
           ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
           IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
           WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
           PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
           ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
           KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
           ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      
        b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
           TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
           NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
           INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
           COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
           USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
           ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
           DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
           IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      
        c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
           above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
           possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
           waiver of all liability.
      
      
      Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
      
        a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
           Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
           this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
           terminate automatically.
      
        b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
           Section 6(a), it reinstates:
      
             1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                violation; or
      
             2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
      
           For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
           right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
           of this Public License.
      
        c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
           Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
           distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
           will not terminate this Public License.
      
        d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
           License.
      
      
      Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
      
        a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
           terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
      
        b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
           Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
           independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
      
      
      Section 8 -- Interpretation.
      
        a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
           shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
           conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
           be made without permission under this Public License.
      
        b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
           deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
           minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
           cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
           without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
           conditions.
      
        c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
           failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
           Licensor.
      
        d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
           as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
           that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
           processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and
      
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and
      
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.
      
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
      
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
      
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
